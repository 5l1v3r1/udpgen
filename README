 Description:

 A simple  UDP TRAFFIC GENERATOR
 Evaluate % of successful packets compared to transmitted packets

 Compilation:

 gcc ipgen.c -o ipgen -O3

 There are two types of unsuccessful packages
 1. Loss or drop by lower layers.
 2. Fail the checksum.
 This program counts both losses.

 Packet structure:
 4 bytes for seq | n bytes for Data | 2 bytes for checksum

 Usage: ./udpgen [-v] -[s|c] [-n NUM_PACKET] [-l PACKET_LENGTH_IN_BYTES] [-b BANDWIDTH_IN_BYTES_PER_SEC] IPADDRESS PORT
 -v means verbose
 -s means server
 -c means client
 
 e.g.
 ./udpgen -vcl 1000 -b 10000 127.0.0.1 5556
 ./udogen -vsl 1000 127.0.0.1 5556
